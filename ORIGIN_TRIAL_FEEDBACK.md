# Origin Trial Feedback

1. The API was easy to use.
2. The API would be a lot more useful if it was available in the background (i.e. from push). See #5, #28

## Other Requests
Have the API work on tabs.
- This would not change the API design.
- We would like to add this in future.


Make it possible to change the Badge colour.
- Platform support would be limited (possibly only Windows).
- Could be explored as a future extension.

## Implementation Specific Feedback (Chrome)
On Windows, the API would be much more useful if application shortcuts and start menu icons were badged.
- This would make things more consistent with Mac. See Issue #30
- Probably difficult, we'd have to crawl shortcuts and update icons.

Closing a PWA on Mac closes the entire PWA, so the badge disappears.
- Not really a badging specific issue.
