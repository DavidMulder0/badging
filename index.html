        This specification defines an API allowing <a data-cite=
        "appmanifest">web applications</a> to set an application-wide badge,
        shown in an operating-system-specific place associated with the
        application (such as the shelf or home screen), for the purpose of
        notifying the user when the state of the application has changed (e.g.,
        when new messages have arrived), without showing a popup notification.

        This specification is currently a work in progress. Implementors should
        not expose the API surface to the open web.
