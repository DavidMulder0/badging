# Origin Trial Feedback

1. The API was easy to use.
2. The API would be a lot more useful if it was available in the background
   (i.e. from push). See [#5](https://github.com/WICG/badging/issues/5),
   [#28](https://github.com/WICG/badging/issues/28).

## Other Requests
Have the API work on tabs.
- This would not change the API design.
- We would like to add this in future.

Make it possible to change the Badge colour.
- Platform support would be limited (possibly only Windows).
- Could be explored as a future extension.
